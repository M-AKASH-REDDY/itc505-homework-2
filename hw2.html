    <h2>About this Collection</h2>

    <p>The Center for Applied Linguistics Collection contains 118 hours of recordings documenting North American English dialects. The recordings include speech samples, linguistic interviews, oral histories, conversations, and excerpts from public speeches. They were drawn from various archives, and from the private collections of fifty collectors, including linguists, dialectologists, and folklorists. They were submitted to the Center for Applied Linguistics as part of a project entitled "A Survey and Collection of American English Dialect Recordings," which was funded by the Center for Applied Linguistics and the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>

    <h2>Collection Details</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Number of Recordings: 405</li>
        <li>Recording Period: 1941 to 1984</li>
        <li>Geographic Coverage: Forty-three states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and parts of Canada</li>
        <li>Main Recording Period: 1968 to 1982</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In some cases, transcripts (and partial transcripts) made by the collectors are available as part of this web presentation. The survey's documentation covers social aspects of English language usage in different regions of the United States. It reveals distinctions in speech related to gender, race, social class, education, age, literacy, ethnic background, and occupational group (including the specialized jargon or vocabulary of various occupations).</p>

    <h3>Topics Covered</h3>

    <p>The oral history interviews are a rich resource on many topics, such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Storytelling and family histories</li>
        <li>Descriptions of holiday celebrations, traditional farming, schools, education, health care, and the uses of traditional medicines</li>
        <li>Discussions of race relations, politics, and natural disasters such as floods</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Background</h3>

    <p>In 1983, The Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL), under a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, initiated the "Survey and Collection of American English Dialect Recordings," which was undertaken to compile a directory of American speech samples, and ultimately to improve access to them. There were two parts to the project. The first part surveyed collectors of speech samples and resulted in a report entitled "American English Speech Recordings: A Guide to Collections" which describes over 200 collections. The second part of the project was designed to select from the 200 collections a representative sample of recordings with the goal of "creating a centralized source of American dialect samples and to provide for the preservation of this valuable resource that might otherwise be lost."</p>
